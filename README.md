React application is created using create-reaact app CLI (npx)

Installation Process(npm should be installed):

Navigate to the folder , open CLI and type npm install (This will install dependencies from package.json)
*Only axios is  installed explicitly through npm install 
After installing dependencies, run below command:
npm start -->This will start localhost on port mentioned in CLI (might vary from 3000 if not free)
Open Chrome Browser and hit the URL:
ex: http://localhost:3000/  (Port number might vary , please check CLI)

Enter address and confirm.


*Build chunk files can be generated by running 'npm run-script build' in CLI

Code Flow OverView :

Main Component (App.js) loads google api library and based on the input entered shows auto complete suggestions.
After input is selected, we get the longitude and latitude of the place via getplaces() method.
The longitude and latitude is then used by Weatherdetails component which then makes API call to openweather app and gets the weather information and displays.
